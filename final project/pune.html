GEMINI, 6°51'59"
FIFTH HOUSE
The sun determines your ego, identity, and "role" in life. It's the core of who you are, and is the sign you're most likely to already know. Your Sun is in Gemini, meaning you are fundamentally dynamic, quick-witted, eclectic, and curious. Fascinated by everything, your childlike energy is often scattered in a million directions. On a social level, this may come off as gossipy or flaky. It's in your fifth house, meaning you feel the need to distinguish yourself from others through romance, self-expression, creativity, and pleasure.

ASCENDANT
CAPRICORN, 25°11'3"
FIRST HOUSE
Your ascendant is the "mask" you present to people. It can be seen in your personal style and how you come off to people when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as you get older. It changes every two hours, so if it doesn't make sense, text your mom to confirm your birth time. Your Ascendant is in Capricorn, meaning you come across as conservative, serious, and rational—perhaps even grave. You seem to make decisions in a responsible, practical, and prudent way. Your ambitions may come off as opportunistic.

MOON
LEO, 5°48'17"
SEVENTH HOUSE
The moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your personality when you're alone or deeply comfortable. Your Moon is in Leo, meaning your emotional self is dramatic, proud, expressive, idealistic, and somewhat self-centered. You need a lot of love, care, and validation from other people. It's in your seventh house, meaning you find security and safety through close relationships and long-term partnerships.

MERCURY
GEMINI, 28°33'12"
FIFTH HOUSE
Mercury determines how you communicate, talk, think, and process information. It also indicates how you learn. It is the mind's planet. Your Mercury is in Gemini, meaning your intellect is dynamic, quick-witted, and eclectic. You're deeply curious about everything, and your energy is often scattered in a million directions. The way you speak is articulate and witty, but you're likely to talk behind people's backs. It's in your fifth house, meaning you are curious about and inclined to analyze your love life, how to become happy, and your creative projects.

VENUS
GEMINI, 17°47'50"
FIFTH HOUSE
Venus determines how and what you love. It indicates how you express affection and the qualities you're attracted to. Your Venus is in Gemini, meaning your romantic side is dynamic, curious, and easily bored. You love witty banter, but you may have trouble deepening your relationships. You tend to be a bit timid and discreet with your crushes, because you don't know how to be forthright. It's in your fifth house, meaning that for you, love is often expressed in romance, self-expression, creativity, and pleasure.

MARS
PISCES, 9°50'36"
SECOND HOUSE
Mars is the planet of aggression. It determines how you assert yourself, take action, and the energy that surrounds you—particularly in your sex life, your ambitiousness, and when you're angry. Your Mars is in Pisces, meaning you assert yourself in a way that is dreamy, intuitive, and thoughtful, and you push things forward with imagination and emotion. It's in your second house, meaning you put a lot of energy into money and material possessions.

JUPITER
CAPRICORN, 26°58'13"
FIRST HOUSE
One of the two social planets, Jupiter rules idealism, optimism, and expansion. It's also very philosophical. Your Jupiter is in Capricorn, meaning you grow and find understanding through responsibility, practicality, ambition, seriousness, efficiency, rationality, and power. It's in your first house, meaning you find success through your self and self-image—and, because it's your first house, your Jupiter in Capricorn is hyper-present in your personality.

SATURN
AQUARIUS, 1°44'18"
FIRST HOUSE
The other social planet, Saturn rules responsibility, restrictions, limits, boundaries, fears, and self-discipline. Your Saturn is in Aquarius, meaning you struggle with obstinacy, a superiority complex, and being overly detached. It's in your first house, meaning you have had difficulties with your self and self-image—and, because it's your first house, your Saturn in Aquarius is hyper-present in your personality.

URANUS
TAURUS, 8°20'56"
FOURTH HOUSE
Uranus stays in each sign for seven years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules innovation, rebellion, and progress. Your Uranus is in Taurus, meaning other generations are shocked by your generation's decadence, orientation towards security, and stubbornness. It's in your fourth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in rebelling against dated expectations about the home and family.

NEPTUNE
PISCES, 20°46'38"
SECOND HOUSE
Neptune stays in each sign for around fourteen years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules dreams, imagination, and the unconscious. Your Neptune is in Pisces, meaning your entire generation finds inspiration through empathy, dreaminess, and compassion. It's in your second house, meaning that for you, this manifests in your ideal—verging on unrealistic and impractical—about money and material possessions.

PLUTO
CAPRICORN, 24°45'21"
TWELFTH HOUSE
Pluto stays in each sign for up to thirty years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules power, intensity, obsession, and control. Your Pluto is in Capricorn, meaning your generation's psyche is comparatively responsible, conservative, practical, rational, and power-hungry. It's in your twelfth house, meaning you personally are transforming outdated expectations of privacy, secrets, and introspection.</pre>
